The only redeeming facet of Support Group was this 
kid named Isaac, a long faced, skinny guy with straight 
blond hair swept over one eye. 

And his eyes were the problem. He had some 
fantastically improbable eye cancer. One eye had been cut 
out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick 
glasses that made his eyes preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically 
just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. From what 
I could gather on the rare occasions when Isaac shared with 
the group, a recurrence had placed his remaining eye in 
mortal peril. 

Isaac and I communicated almost exclusively through 
sighs. Each time someone discussed anticancer diets or 
snorting ground up shark fin or whatever, he'd glance 
over at me and sigh ever so slightly. I'd shake my head 
microscopically and exhale in response. 

So Support Group blew, and after a few weeks, I grew to 
be rather kicking and screaming about the whole affair. 
In fact, on the Wednesday I made the acquaintance of 
Augustus Waters, I tried my level best to get out of Support 
Group while sitting on the couch with my mom in the third 
leg of a twelve hour marathon of the previous season's 
America's Next Top Model, which admittedly I had already 
seen, but still. 
Lida was sixteen, and pretty enough to be the object 
of the hot boy's eye. She was a regular in a long remission 
from appendiceal cancer, which I had not previously known 
existed. She said as she had every other time I had attended 
Support Group that she felt strong, which felt like bragging 
to me as the oxygen drizzling nubs tickled my nostrils.
